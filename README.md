# Study App

Study App is a simple application written in C# with Windows Forms that helps you randomly choose terms from a list and open associated URLs. This tool is designed to assist in studying by presenting random terms and associated information for review.

## Getting Started

To use Study App, follow these steps:
Ensure you have a file named **test.txt** with terms and URLs in the following format:
```plaintext
NumberOfTerms
Term1
URL1
Term2
URL2
```
Place this file in **C:/StudyApp/**.
  
- The first button chooses a random term, from the terms that are not familiar and known to you.
- The second button is used to mark the term as familiar and place it in testowy.txt
